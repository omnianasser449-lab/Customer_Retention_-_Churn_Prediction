📊 Telecom Customer Retention AI
The Goal
Identify "at-risk" customers and the drivers of churn to reduce customer loss and protect recurring monthly revenue.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Seaborn)
Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier (Supervised Learning)
Data Engineering: Type-conversion and label encoding for high-quality AI training.

💡 Key Insights
The Accuracy: Built a predictive model that identifies potential "Leavers" with 75.73% accuracy.
The "Fiber" Flaw: Discovered that Fiber Optic customers have the highest churn rate despite having faster service, suggesting a price-to-value mismatch.
Contract Risk: Month-to-month customers are 6x more likely to churn than those on 2-year contracts.
Tenure vs. Cost: Longer tenure significantly reduces churn risk, regardless of high monthly charges.

🚀 Strategy Recommendation
Implement a "Contract Migration" campaign. Offer a 5-10 monthly discount to Month-to-Month Fiber Optic users if they switch to a 1-year contract. This "locks in" high-value revenue and addresses the price sensitivity found in the data.
